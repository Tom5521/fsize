# fsize

This is a project of mine, basically to end my problem with
the damn stat command that is unreadable.

Also because I had free time and a desire to do something different
that does not focus on Microsoft Windows.

The project is focused to be simple and easy to read,
so don't expect very advanced functions, but I will probably
add more according to my needs.
